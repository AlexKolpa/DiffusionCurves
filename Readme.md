# DiffusionCurves System
This repo contains the source code to the DiffusionCurves System, our Bachelor Project. 

## Usage
To completely use and run the source, you require several libraries:

* 64-bit EmguCV
* OpenTK
* NUnit
* Rhino Mocks

Besides this, you also need to add the OpenCV dll's in the OpenCV folder in the repo. These dll's can be easily obtained by installing EmguCV.
